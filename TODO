TODO list

more or less in the order of priorities. Non exhaustive.

- Create a small GUI to ask the user for numerical values (at best ask all values in one single dialog)
- Show the joint parameters when a joint is selected
- Rename "Scientific representation"
- Solve TODOs inside the code.
- Improve comments and code quality.

Not part of the current project:
- Save as .par file instead of .geo file
- Use real shapes for the graphical representation with a property in the
  "View" tab to switch  between real shapes and schematic representation.
- Improve robustness of the loop-closure optimisation (i.e. detection of singular Jacobian).
- Manage all kind of mechanisms (detect the most inner loops and start to solve these)
- Print the inertia parameters when a link is selected.
- Change the shape of the links to represent their inertia
